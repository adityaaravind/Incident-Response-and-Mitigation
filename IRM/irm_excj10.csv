  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

						YOUR CONTRACTOR - HEATING, AIR CONDITIONING &amp; PLUMBING SPECIALISTS
					</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>Perfect Comfort Inc.</strong>, is a trusted, fully insured <a href='https://www.perfectcomfort.us/'>contractor</a> located in Salisbury Mills, NY in Orange County. We have been in business in the Orange County NY & Hudson Valley, NY area for several years and have been mostly involved in new construction and renovation <a href='https://www.perfectcomfort.us/services/heating-installation-hudson-valley.php'>installation of heating</a>, air conditioning and plumbing systems. Our service department consists of highly trained service technicians to better serve customers. We have installed several systems, which include both residential and commercial applications, in Orange, Rockland, Westchester, Putnam, Sullivan, and Dutchess Counties. Perfect Comfort is proud to be part of the privatization of military housing in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We are also proud to work for Balfour Beatty, a worldwide renowned company in renovating these historic homes. Excellence in craftsmanship and service are our top priorities. The goal we achieve is to deliver quality products and service at the most competitive prices.
					</p><!-- Removed 06/20/17 <h2 style=""color: black;"">Keeping Your Vents Clear Could Save Your Life</h2>
            <p>With the recent resurgence of cold weather we've had in the past couple weeks, it seems winter isn't ready to let us go quite yet. In the wake of these freak winter storms, it is not uncommon to suddenly find yourself with a full list of additional chores to do around the house to clear everything up. This can be especially true if you've just had a bunch of snow dumped on your property. However, in addition to shoveling the snow away from your driveway, it is extremely important that you make sure your furnace, <a href='https://www.perfectcomfort.us/services/water-heaters-hudson-valley.php'>water heater</a>, and dryer vents are all clear of snow as well, and we'll tell you why. Whether you heat your home with oil or gas, your system has an exhaust pipe of some kind that is going to terminate outside of your home somewhere. In older homes this could be led up a chimney, but in newer homes, it tends to go through your walls directly outside your home. Normally, if these exhaust vents become blocked, the system will stall, whether from lack of oxygen getting into the system or because of the systems' built in safety mechanisms, and the system may just not turn back on until the blockage is cleared. However, when these exhaust pipes are covered by snow, what is known as a snow cave can sometimes form, trapping exhaust fumes and the CO2 produced as a result of the ignition process, and leaving them nowhere to go but back inside your home through cracks or gaps. For this reason, it is extremely important that you make yourself aware of where your home's exhaust vents are, and make sure you clean any standing snow away from them immediately in the wake of a storm. Not only will this keep your system functioning, keeping you and your family warm, but it might also save your lives.</p> -->

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

using a weak hashing algorithm.","The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a 
cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be 
vulnerable to collision attacks (CVE-2004-2761, for example). An attacker can exploit this to generate another 
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as 
vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Note that this plugin will only fire on root certificates that are known certificate authorities as listed in Tenable 
Community Knowledge Article 000001752. That is what differentiates this plugin from plugin 35291, which will fire on any
certificate, not just known certificate authority root certificates.
